This is my implementation of the UNIX Shell in C Language

Instructions to compile

1. Open the terminal and enter into the particular directory. Then execute the make command which will compile the code
2. Then execute ./shell
3. For File I/O, we can execute the echo command.
4. Ex- echo "Hello World" > 1.txt creates a new file named 1.txt and inserts the text "Hello World" into it.
5. Ex- wc < 1.txt command gives the count of the number of lines, words and characters in the file.
6. All the commands like clear, ls, cd, pwd, kill can be entered in the console.
7. The code generates a help file which acts as a instruction manual of all the commands implemented.
